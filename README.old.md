# Test before Technical Test ðŸŽ¯

Here, the goal was to create a progressbar using React and JS.
This project has been created using: `yarn create react-app __name`
It's been made in approximately 45min with a lot of thinking on wether I should use Redux or not?

## Before launch

Run: `npm install` or `yarn`;

## To start the project

Run: `npm run start` or `yarn start`
